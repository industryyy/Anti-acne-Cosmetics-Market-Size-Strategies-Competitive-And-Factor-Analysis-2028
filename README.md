# Anti-acne-Cosmetics-Market-Size-Strategies-Competitive-And-Factor-Analysis-2028
The major driving force behind the growth of anti-acne cosmetic products is the increased use of cosmetic products by men, the emergence of organic cosmetics, and increased urbanization in many developing countries across the globe. Few decades only, women were using anti-acne cosmetic products; however, men are increasingly using cosmetics in recent years.
Several well-known skincare brands are launching anti-acne cosmetic products specifically for men. Previously, most products were chemical-based cosmetics, but in recent years, organic cosmetics were introduced in the industry due to fewer side effects associated with them.
According to the clinical data published by Dermatology Times, in April 2021, tazarotene 0.045 % lotion was effective for treating facial acne. The trial was conducted on 1,612 patients by ortho dermatologists, and the lotion improves the quality of life in both moderate and severely affected acne patients.

Creams & lotions dominated the market in 2020, as they’re the first line of treatment for all forms of acne and offer surface moisturization. Increased demand for these products, as it provides protection from bacteria and skin diseases such as psoriasis, will further help maintain significant market share during the forecast timeframe.
COVID-19 pandemic is expected to play a less significant role in the growth of the global market. Most of the anti-acne products are used in-home care treatment, which requires no medical advice, and hence even during the pandemic, the consumer base for the products is seeing an upward growth.
Many companies are entering into a collaboration to develop new innovative products. GlaxoSmithKline entered into USD 224 million partnership with Eligo in January 2021 to develop a treatment known as Eligobiotics that will target bacteria that causes acne. Key companies are also expanding their business to maintain a competitive edge.
In August 2020, Cassiopea SpA in Italy had developed an acne treatment Winlevi (clascoterone cream 1 percent) that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Winlevi is the first of its kind acne treatment with a novel mode of action to receive FDA approval in the U.S. In April 2021, Teva Pharmaceuticals announced the U.S. launch of Absorica capsules to treat severe recalcitrant nodular acne in patients aged 12 and above.
